#My-first-website
#### It's a trial version to learn how to build websites with the skills I've gathered since Tuesday., November 22nd 2018

#### **By Francis Mwangi**

## Description
The webpage is a simple site that talks mostly about Moringa school. It highlights what Moringa School is and isn't adept at in terms of teaching. We highlight the topics taught at the school and which animal the school has in house complete with a picture. There's also a link that redirects you to the main Moringa School website in case you would want to apply to one of their programs.The main purpose of this website however is to learn.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
Thankfully there are no code dependancies, no installation processes and no database setups seeing as this is a website which means we won't eat up your space. All you need is a good internet connection and the website address.

## Known Bugs
There are no known bugs yet but if you come across one please reach out to me on abcdef@gmail.com. I will be more than happy to fix it and in the process learn some more. For your effort, a coffee will be attached to my hearty thanks.

## Technologies Used
I used basic HTML when building my site. As you can see it's a pretty basic site seeing as I've only had these skills for two days. In terms of CSS I have played around with the colours, fonts and text alignment.

## Support and contact details
As pointed out above please reach out to me for any bugs, style inconsistencies and anything else on abcdef@gmail.com. Your feedback is most welcome as it will allow me to learn and grow.
